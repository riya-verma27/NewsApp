Technical Aspects
### 1. Component-Based Architecture
The application is organized into distinct, reusable class based components, making the structure modular and easy to maintain:

**NavBar**: Manages the navigation bar and links to different categories.
**News**: Fetches and displays news articles for the selected category, handling pagination and infinite scrolling.
**NewsItem**: Displays individual news articles with details such as title, description, image, and publication date.
**Spinner**: A loading spinner that appears during content loading phases.
### 2. State Management
**State Management**:
The application manages different states, including:

Loading State: Indicates when articles are being fetched from the API.
Progress State: Used by the top-loading bar to show the progress of content loading.
### 3. React Router
**Routing**:
React Router is used to handle client-side routing. It enables navigation between different news categories (like Business, Sports, etc.) without reloading the page, maintaining a smooth user experience.

### 4. API Integration
**News API**:
The app fetches news articles from the News API using the provided API key. The News component makes asynchronous API calls to retrieve articles based on the selected category.

### 5. Infinite Scrolling
**Infinite Scrolling**:
The application uses the react-infinite-scroll-component library to implement infinite scrolling, allowing users to load more articles as they scroll down the page.

### 6. Real-Time Progress Indicator
**Progress Indicator**:
A react-top-loading-bar component displays a loading bar at the top of the page, giving users real-time feedback on content loading progress.

### 7. Responsive UI
**Responsive Design**:
Bootstrap is utilized to ensure the application is fully responsive, adapting well to different screen sizes.

### 8. Code Structure
**Code Structure**:
The main components include:

**App.js**: The main component that integrates all other components and handles routing.
**News.js**: Contains logic for fetching and displaying news articles.
**NewsItem.js**: Displays individual articles with details such as title, description, image, and publication date.
